# Downgrooves.Core5
.NET Core 5 WebAPI with Entity Framework Core 5 and SQLite.  This application provides a REST API interface for reading and writing data.  
The API is consumed by the Downgrooves web site at http://www.downgrooves.com as well as the Downgrooves Mobile App.

Downgrooves.com is my personal music project website.  As a DJ and music producer for over 25 years, I have ammased an extensive collection of original music, dj sets and performance YouTube videos.  
This site collects all those resources into a single space.

The original source for the Angular web site that consumes this API can be found at my GitHub at github.com/djericj/Downgrooves
The original source for the Xamarin Forms Mobile app that consumes this API can be found at my GitHub at github.com/djericj/Downgrooves.Mobile

This site and it's companion projects (Downgrooves.Angular, Downgrooves.Mobile) are full participants in the Software Development Lifecycle on Azure DevOps.  Through Azure DevOps, the site is configured with complete build pipelines and releases to a local Development and an AWS-hosted Production environment.
